# Mood Journal

A small application for tracking the psycho-emotional state based on several factors. In memory of my crazy ex :)

Working example can be found here - https://mood-journal.vercel.app

All the data is saved in the browser. You can edit the name and description of the parameters by double-clicking on them. Enter - save, Esc - cancel editing.

The menu at the top right allows you to add a new parameter or fill the application with random test data.
